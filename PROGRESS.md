# PROGRESS.md — RelF self-hosting project log

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. This log exists so future work
(including future Claude sessions, which have no memory of prior ones)
doesn't silently retry a path already found to be wrong.

**For project context, priorities, and phase plan, read `GOALS.md`
first** — that's the stable reference. This file is only the log of what
was actually done, in order, and shouldn't repeat what's already stated
there.

## 2026-08-31 — Iteration 1: scaffolding

### Context

This repository continues work that started as an unrelated investigation
(comparing SOD32 and RelF VM designs for a "busybox on Forth" project) in
a prior chat session, not committed to git at the time. The reasoning
behind choosing RelF as this project's basis, and a load-bearing fact
about RelF's addressing model, are now in `GOALS.md` rather than here —
put there because they're stable context, not iteration history.

### Bugs found and fixed

**Bug 1 — `UNS32`/`INT32` defined as `unsigned long`/`long`.** On the
i386 platform RelF targeted, `unsigned long` is 4 bytes; on this x86_64
host it's 8, silently breaking every 4-byte-cell memory access. This is
the exact issue upstream's own commit `25d3c0b` ("relf is not working on
the 64 bit platforms") documented in 2016 without fixing — it recommended
compiling 32-bit instead. Fixed here by changing the typedefs to
`unsigned int`/`int` (matching SOD32's own header, which avoids this trap
already). **This alone is not sufficient** — see Bug 2.

**Bug 2 (re-discovered from prior session, forgotten and re-hit once
already this iteration) — even with `UNS32` correctly sized, RelF still
needs a genuine 32-bit *process*.** See `GOALS.md`'s note on RelF's
real-pointer addressing model for why. Must build with `gcc -m32`.
**Do not attempt to "fix" this by widening `UNS32` to 8 bytes on a
64-bit build** — that changes the cell width and breaks the existing
`kernel.img`, which was compiled assuming 4-byte cells. The 32-bit build
is correct as-is for the current kernel image; a real 64-bit *cell*
version is a distinct, deliberate future project (phase 2 in `GOALS.md`),
not a side effect of chasing this bug.

**Bug 3 — engine hangs (does not exit) on EOF from stdin when no `BYE`
is reached.** Confirmed by running the bundled `tester.fr` suite: without
an appended `BYE`, the process runs all tests correctly (1841 `OK`,
zero errors) but then hangs indefinitely rather than exiting — `timeout`
killed it (exit 124) rather than it exiting on its own. With `BYE`
appended after the test file, exit code 0, same 1841 `OK`s, zero errors.
**Not fixed yet** — noted because it's directly relevant to the
syscall-based rewrite (phase 2): a raw `read()` returning 0 at EOF
should be treated as "exit cleanly," and currently isn't. Test runner
works around this for now by always appending `BYE`.

### What this iteration did

- Applied Bug 1's fix to `relf.c` (`UNS32`/`INT32` → `unsigned int`/`int`).
- Confirmed the *existing, bundled* `tester.fr` — a working copy of John
  Hayes's 1993 CORE word test suite, already adapted to RelF's `{ -> }`
  test syntax — passes cleanly end to end (1841 `OK`, 0 errors) once
  both bugs above are worked around. This is a significantly better
  starting position than expected: a comprehensive, already-adapted
  regression suite already existed in the repo and was simply never
  being run in any automated way.
- Added `tests/run_tests.sh`, a minimal test runner that builds `relf`,
  runs `tester.fr` (with `BYE` appended per Bug 3's workaround) plus
  `tests/*.fth` through it, and fails loudly on any `ERROR`/non-zero
  exit/non-"OK" output. Verified end to end: full pass, 1892 `OK`
  markers, 0 errors.
- Added `tests/core-extra.fth`: a handful of small, directly-applicable
  tests adapted from `forth2012-test-suite`'s `src/core.fr`
  (arithmetic/stack/boolean ops), written in RelF's own `{ -> }`
  convention rather than porting the `T{ -> }T` framework wholesale (see
  `GOALS.md`'s test suite strategy). Kept the suite's copyright notice
  attached per its terms ("MAY BE DISTRIBUTED FREELY AS LONG AS THIS
  COPYRIGHT NOTICE REMAINS").
- Note (not a bug, not fixed, not worth fixing): `gcc -m32` on `relf.c`
  produces many `-Wimplicit-int`/`-Wimplicit-function-declaration`
  warnings — expected from ~20-year-old pre-C99 K&R-style C compiled by
  a modern compiler default-strict about implicit declarations. Harmless,
  does not affect correctness (all tests pass), not addressed here since
  this file's C form is being replaced/refactored per `GOALS.md`'s
  phase 2, not incrementally modernized.
- Added `GOALS.md` (this iteration, after the above): split the original
  single `PROGRESS.md` into stable context (`GOALS.md`) and pure
  iteration log (`PROGRESS.md`, this file), so a new session can read
  one short, rarely-changing file instead of a growing log to get
  oriented.

### What this iteration deliberately did NOT do

Per the owner's explicit phase-1 scope ("scaffolding + test runner +
process log first, minimal engine changes") — these are next-iteration
work, not forgotten:

- Did not remove libc / move to raw syscalls yet.
- Did not touch `vm.asm`/`vm_tos.asm`/`relfgcc.c` at all.
- Did not restructure/replace old files in place yet (planned per
  `GOALS.md`, but not started).
- Did not port the modern `T{ -> }T` forth2012-test-suite harness itself,
  only borrowed a few test values in RelF's existing convention.
- Did not investigate or fix Bug 3 (EOF hang) — logged, not fixed.
- Did not touch `relfgcc.c` (the labels-as-values GCC variant) — it has
  its own, different 64-bit trap (computed-goto target addresses stored
  in a `UNS32`-sized slot truncate on a 64-bit build for the same
  fundamental reason as Bug 2, but the fix isn't just `-m32`-compatible
  in the same simple way — was observed in prior exploratory work to
  need extra header-inclusion fixes even to compile at `-m32`). Low
  priority — `vm_tos.asm` is the actual performance-relevant target per
  `GOALS.md`'s "why RelF," `relfgcc.c` was never the fast path.

### Workflow notes (process, not project content — logged so future
iterations don't repeat the mistake)

- `git bundle create <file>.bundle master` alone is **not** enough for a
  plain `git pull <file>.bundle` to work on the receiving end — `git
  pull` without an explicit refspec looks for `HEAD` in the bundle, and
  a bundle created with only `master` named doesn't include a `HEAD`
  ref. Always bundle with `git bundle create <file>.bundle HEAD master`
  (or equivalent) so `git pull <file>.bundle` works standalone, without
  requiring `git pull <file>.bundle master`. Hit this exact issue on the
  very first handoff of this project — fixed by regenerating the bundle
  with both refs.

/*
 *  sod16.c - RelF's engine with SOD16 code: one 16-bit token per
 *  operation instead of one host cell.
 *
 *  DERIVED FROM relf.c, DELIBERATELY BY MINIMAL EDIT. The point of this
 *  file is how little of it differs. 64 of the 68 primitives are
 *  byte-for-byte identical to relf.c's, because a primitive's body does
 *  not depend on how code is represented - only on the stacks and
 *  memory, which are unchanged. Just four touch `ip`: exit, lit,
 *  branch, ?branch. Plus NEXT() and the boot sequence.
 *
 *  That is the argument for SOD16 as a change to this project rather
 *  than a rewrite of it, and it should stay true: if this file starts
 *  diverging from relf.c anywhere except the marked places, something
 *  has gone wrong.
 *
 *  WHAT CHANGED
 *
 *    NEXT()     reads a 16-bit token. t < 256 is a primitive index;
 *               t >= 256 is word number t-256, and the target comes
 *               from wordtab[] - one load, no base add, no shift.
 *    L_lit      operand is a 16-bit token, not a cell.
 *    L_branch   offset is in TOKEN units, signed 16-bit. Measured on
 *               the real image, zero branches need more than that.
 *    L_0branch  same.
 *    L_exit     unchanged - the return stack holds ip values either way.
 *
 *  WHAT IS NOT DONE YET
 *
 *    Loading. A token image's bodies are a different size from a cell
 *    image's, so every address in the dictionary moves: link fields,
 *    HERE, and anything a VARIABLE holds that points into the image.
 *    It BOOTS (Iteration 179). Both cell widths run every word that
 *    was compiled into the image: arithmetic, strings, HEX/DECIMAL,
 *    tick, and the whole pre-compiled shell.
 *
 *    It CANNOT COMPILE. `,` and `COMPILE,` write CELLS, so a new
 *    definition lays down cell-threaded code that this engine then
 *    reads as tokens. `: SQ DUP * ;` segfaults. Making the compiler
 *    emit tokens is the next piece, and it is the same work as
 *    GOALS.md's phase 3.
